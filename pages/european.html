                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>This German apple cake makes a moist, dense cake that keeps well. It has been a family favorite for over 20 years. It's delicious served with a dusting of confectioners' sugar.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>4 cups apples - peeled, cored, and diced</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
                    <li>Beat oil and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add sugar and vanilla; beat well.</li>
                    <li>Stir flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add flour mixture to egg mixture; mix until just combined. The batter will be very thick. Fold in apples by hand using a wooden spoon or spatula.</li>
                    <li>Spread batter into the prepared pan.</li>
                    <li>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Cool cake on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
                    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
